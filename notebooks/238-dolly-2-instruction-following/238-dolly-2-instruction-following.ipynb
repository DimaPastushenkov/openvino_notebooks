    "# Instruction following using Databricks Dolly 2.0 and OpenVINO\n",
    "\n",
    "The instruction following is one of the cornerstones of the current generation of large language models(LLMs). Reinforcement learning with human preferences ([RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08593)) and techniques such as [InstructGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155) has been the core foundation of breakthroughs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. However, these powerful models remain hidden behind APIs and we know very little about their underlying architecture. Instruction-following models are capable of generating text in response to prompts and are often used for tasks like writing assistance, chatbots, and content generation. Many users now interact with these models regularly and even use them for work but the majority of such models remain closed-source and require massive amounts of computational resources to experiment with.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Dolly 2.0](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/04/12/dolly-first-open-commercially-viable-instruction-tuned-llm) is the first open-source, instruction-following LLM fine-tuned by Databricks on a transparent and freely available dataset that is also open-sourced to use for commercial purposes. That means Dolly 2.0 is available for commercial applications without the need to pay for API access or share data with third parties. Dolly 2.0 exhibits similar characteristics so ChatGPT despite being much smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we consider how to run an instruction-following text generation pipeline using Dolly 2.0 and OpenVINO. We will use a pre-trained model from the [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) library. To simplify the user experience, the [Hugging Face Optimum](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum) library is used to convert the models to OpenVINO™ IR format.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Install prerequisites\n",
    "- Download and convert the model from a public source using the [OpenVINO integration with Hugging Face Optimum](https://huggingface.co/blog/openvino).\n",
    "- Create an instruction-following inference pipeline\n",
    "- Run instruction-following pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## About Dolly 2.0\n",
    "\n",
    "Dolly 2.0 is an instruction-following large language model trained on the Databricks machine-learning platform that is licensed for commercial use. It is based on [Pythia](https://github.com/EleutherAI/pythia) and is trained on ~15k instruction/response fine-tuning records generated by Databricks employees in various capability domains, including brainstorming, classification, closed QA, generation, information extraction, open QA, and summarization.\n",
    "Dolly 2.0 works by processing natural language instructions and generating responses that follow the given instructions. It can be used for a wide range of applications, including closed question-answering, summarization, and generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model training process was inspired by [InstructGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155). To train InstructGPT models, the core technique is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), This technique uses human preferences as a reward signal to fine-tune models, which is important as the safety and alignment problems required to be solved are complex and subjective, and aren’t fully captured by simple automatic metrics. More details about the InstructGPT approach can be found in OpenAI [blog post](https://openai.com/research/instruction-following) \n",
    "The breakthrough discovered with InstructGPT is that language models don’t need larger and larger training sets. By using human-evaluated question-and-answer training, authors were able to train a better language model using one hundred times fewer parameters than the previous model. Databricks used a similar approach to create a prompt and response dataset called they call [databricks-dolly-15k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/databricks/databricks-dolly-15k), a corpus of more than 15,000 records generated by thousands of Databricks employees to enable large language models to exhibit the magical interactivity of ChatGPT. More details about the model and dataset can be found in [Databricks blog post](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/04/12/dolly-first-open-commercially-viable-instruction-tuned-llm) and [repo](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dolly)"

    "## Create an instruction-following inference pipeline\n",

    " The `run_generation` function accepts user-provided text input, tokenizes it, and runs the generation process. Text generation is an iterative process, where each next token depends on previously generated until a maximum number of tokens or stop generation condition is not reached. To obtain intermediate generation results without waiting until when generation is finished, we will use [TextIteratorStreamer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.TextIteratorStreamer), provided as part of HuggingFace [Streaming API](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/generation_strategies#streaming).\n",

    "\n",
    "As can be seen, on the first iteration, the user provided instructions converted to token ids using a tokenizer, then prepared input provided to the model. The model generates probabilities for all tokens in logits format  The way the next token will be selected over predicted probabilities is driven by the selected decoding methodology. You can find more information about the most popular decoding methods in this [blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate). To optimize the generation process and use memory more efficiently, the `use_cache=True` option is enabled. Since the output side is auto-regressive, an output token hidden state remains the same once computed for every further generation step. Therefore, recomputing it every time you want to generate a new token seems wasteful. With the cache, the model saves the hidden state once it has been computed. The model only computes the one for the most recently generated output token at each time step, re-using the saved ones for hidden tokens. This reduces the generation complexity from O(n^3) to O(n^2) for a transformer model. More details about how it works can be found in this [article](https://scale.com/blog/pytorch-improvements#Text%20Translation). With this option, the model gets the previous step's hidden states (cached attention keys and values) as input and additionally provides hidden states for the current step as output. It means for all next iterations, it is enough to provide only a new token obtained from the previous step and cached key values to get the next token prediction. The generation cycle repeats until the end of the sequence token is reached or it also can be interrupted when maximum tokens will be generated. As already mentioned before, we can enable printing current generated tokens without waiting until when the whole generation is finished using Streaming API, it adds a new token to the output queue and then prints them when they are ready."
